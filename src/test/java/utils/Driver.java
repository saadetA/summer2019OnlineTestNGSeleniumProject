            in OOP we have design patterns:
                It's a proven for specific task
                One of the most popular design pattern for WebDriver in Selenium is SingleTon
                    SingleTon means single object of something for entire project
                           --> This Object will be static and we can ensure that all tests use same driver object
                                So we can create Test suits
                                Also whenever we need to use driver, we will just call it from Driver class.
                                The same driver will be used in every class
                                the alternative is to create a new driver for each class
